You can put together a simple game in Haskell in just a few hours. This page contains
examples of Haskell games written using different techniques, from good-old imperative
IO code to FRP.

## Raindrops

[Raindrops](../blob/master/examples/raindrops/) is a game in which you need to
collect things as they drop from the sky. The more you collect, the faster they
drop. The game has no final level. How far can you go?

This game combines the following features:
* SDL 1.2
* Wiimote support
* Imperative programming
* Basic physics

## Haskanoid

[Haskanoid](http://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid) is an implementation
of breakout (Arkanoid) in Haskell. It combines the following features:

* SDL 1.2 (graphics and audio)
* Wiimote and kinect support
* Functional Reactive Programming
* Basic Physics
